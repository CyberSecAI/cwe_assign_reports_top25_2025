# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10019

# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in the `start_app_server` function of parisneo/lollms-webui V12 (Strawberry) allows for path traversal and **OS command injection**. The function does not properly sanitize the `app_name` parameter, enabling an attacker to upload a malicious `server.py` file and execute arbitrary code by exploiting the **path traversal vulnerability**.
