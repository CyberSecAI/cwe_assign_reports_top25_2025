The application **fails to properly sanitize** the `app_name` parameter (**ROOTCAUSE**).\n2.  This leads to a **path traversal vulnerability** (**CWE-22** [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]), allowing an attacker to upload a malicious `server.py` file to an arbitrary location.\n3.

The primary weakness is **CWE-78** [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] because the ultimate goal of the attacker is to execute arbitrary commands on the system. However, this is only possible because of the path traversal vulnerability **CWE-22** [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')], which allows the attacker to place the malicious file in a location where it can be executed.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"A vulnerability in the `start_app_server` function of parisneo/lollms-webui V12 (Strawberry) allows for path traversal and **OS command injection**.
