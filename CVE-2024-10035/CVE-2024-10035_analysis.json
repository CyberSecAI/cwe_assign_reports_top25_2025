The vulnerability description indicates command injection, and this CWE is the most specific and appropriate for OS command injection. |\n| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. While the description mentions \"Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)\", the context strongly suggests OS command injection. This CWE is broader and less specific. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-77, CWE-78 and CWE-94.\nCWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, indicating a specialization of command injection related to OS commands. CWE-94 is a broader category of code injection, with CWE-77 as a child.\nThe tool's retriever results and the vulnerability description's focus on \"command injection\" lead to choosing CWE-78 as the primary, with CWE-94 as a possible broader classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe78 -- CHILDOF --> cwe77\n    cwe77 -- CHILDOF --> cwe94\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of code generation**, leading to the specific weakness of **command injection**. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified both CWE-78 and CWE-94 as potential candidates. However, the specific mention of \"**command injection**\" and the broader context suggest that CWE-78 is the more accurate and specific classification. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)** vulnerability in BG-TEK Informatics Security Technologies CoslatV3 allows **Command Injection**\". This direct reference to command injection, combined with the retriever results, supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE. While CWE-94 is also mentioned in the description, it is a broader category and less specific than CWE-78 in this context.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of CWEs related to code and command injection. This helped to determine the optimal level of specificity for the classification.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the type of command injection vulnerability described, while CWE-94 captures the broader aspect of code generation control.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-184 was not selected, as there's no indication that the application uses a denylist to prevent command injection.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-183 was not selected, as there's no indication that the application uses an allowlist that is too permissive.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-74 was not selected as it's a high-level class, and more specific CWEs like CWE-78 are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-80 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to command injection, not cross-site scripting.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
