## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of code generation**, leading to the specific weakness of **command injection**. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified both CWE-78 and CWE-94 as potential candidates. However, the specific mention of "**command injection**" and the broader context suggest that CWE-78 is the more accurate and specific classification. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)** vulnerability in BG-TEK Informatics Security Technologies CoslatV3 allows **Command Injection**". This direct reference to command injection, combined with the retriever results, supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE. While CWE-94 is also mentioned in the description, it is a broader category and less specific than CWE-78 in this context.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of CWEs related to code and command injection. This helped to determine the optimal level of specificity for the classification.
The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the type of command injection vulnerability described, while CWE-94 captures the broader aspect of code generation control.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
